# CNVfinder #

* CNVfinder is a Python 3.x package for copy number variation (CNV) detection on whole exome sequencing (WES) data from amplicon-based enrichment technologies. Besides the [BED](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format1) and [BAM](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/bam) (binary SAM) files, the user may specify a [VCF](http://www.internationalgenome.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-40/) (Variant Call Format) file for each BAM file, allowing a more accurate analysis.   

### Install with pip ###
